**SARS-CoV-2 Lineage Dynamics (online and in-person discussion)** 

For our discussion, read the point-counterpoint paper: [Establishment and lineage dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the UK](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.abf2946) 

Leading up to our in-person discussion, we would like to start the conversation online via Canvas. Go to the discussion linked below and share your thoughts, questions, and/or comments with everyone. And respond to comments posted by others. Participation in the online discussion thread will be considered for the discussion grade in class. Then, on March 1st, we will continue the conversation from the online discussion in person. **Make sure you contribute at least one comment to the Canvas discussion by 5 PM on March 2** (feel free to continue posting after that time).
