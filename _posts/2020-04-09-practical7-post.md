title: "Practical: Fitting Evolutionary Models to Continuous Data"
ptype: practical
---

##### Overview

Today we investigate methods of fitting evolutionary models for continuous characters. The goal of such methods is to fit multiple competing evolutionary models: BM1, OU1, multi-rate BM models, etc., and determine which model has the strongest support given the data and the phylogeny.

NOTE: lecture is in video format, and is found on the Panopto link of our Canvas page (link on the left-hand side).
