##### Overview

This tutorial is intended to provide an introduction to the basics of implementing several phylogenetic comparative methods using R. As with previous tutorials, we begin with a brief conceptual overview, which sets the stage for why this is type of analysis is crucial for correct macroevolutionary inference. Then, we go over the basics of reading data and phylogenies into R, evaluating the degree to which phylogenetic signal is present in a continuous trait, and learn three ways to examine bivariate trait associations in continuous data: phylogenetically independent contrasts (PIC), phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS), and phylogenetic transformation methods.
