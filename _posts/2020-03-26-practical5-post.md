title: "Practical: Ancestral State Estimation"
ptype: practical
---

##### Overview

Today we investigate methods of ancestral state estimation, and implement them for discrete and continuous traits. 
For discrete data, we will utilize two approaches: maximum likelihood and Bayesian stochastic character mapping. 
For continuous traits, we will use maximum likelihood: which is equivalent to both GLS and squared-change parsimony implementations
(we will also use a Bayesian MCMC approach to incorporate fossil information at nodes as well). 

NOTE: lecture is in video format, and is found on the Panopto link of our Canvas page (link on the left-hand side).
