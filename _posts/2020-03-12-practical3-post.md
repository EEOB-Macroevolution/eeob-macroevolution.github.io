title: "Practical: Discrete Trait Phylogenetic Association"

##### Overview

Today we continue our investigation of correlated trait evolution, and implement methods for examining trait associations in discrete traits. Conceptually, the challenge is little different from what was examined for continuous variables. Specifically, we wish to identify an association between two variables while accounting for (e.g., conditioning) the data on the phylogeny. For bivariate regression, we used one of three implementations of phylogenetic generalized least squares: phylogenetically independent contrasts (PIC), phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS), and phylogenetic transformation. For trait associations between discrete changes, we use likelihood or Bayesian approaches.
