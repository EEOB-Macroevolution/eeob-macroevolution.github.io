##### Overview

For our discussion, read the point-counterpoint paper: Does evolutionary theory need a rethink? Our in-class discussion will be a _moderated debate_, and proceed as follows:

1. Every student will be assigned a position: (1) Yes, urgently or (2) No, all is well. (See [Canvas](https://canvas.iastate.edu/courses/68351/pages/discussion-jan-30-point-vs-counterpoint-does-evolutionary-theory-need-a-rethink) for the position you were assigned.)
	1. Be sure to read both sides, regardless of the one you were assigned. 
	2. Consider the question with regard to theory on both microevolution and macroevolution.
2. At the start of class, we will give you 10 minutes to organize so that you can strategize your debate with your groups.
3. Our discussion will begin with opening remarks, with each side allowed 10 minutes. The side arguing "Yes, urgently" will deliver their opening remarks first. It is up to each group to decide how to deliver the opening arguments (e.g., you can elect 1 or 2 spokespersons, each present a critical point, etc.)
4. Once the opening remarks are finished, each side will have 5 minutes of rebuttal. 
5. The discussion will proceed with continued debate and moderated questions.
